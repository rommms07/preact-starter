The Koolie is believed to be descended from the same Collie types that were brought to Australia for the kennels of Thomas S. Hall (an originator of the Australian Cattle Dog breed); some believe that they could be direct descendants of Hall&#39;s dogs. While some believe the &#39;German Coolie&#39; to be descended from the &#39;German Tiger&#39;, a European herding dog, there is no genetic or even anecdotal evidence to support this claim. A more plausible theory is that these dogs were used by German immigrants in South Australia who, unable to correctly pronounce &#39;collie&#39;, referred to the dogs as &#39;coolies&#39;. Others have noted strong similarities with the Australian Koolie and the Welsh Collie, another British herding subtype.",

Despite the fact that this breed is not yet recognized by the ANKC as a pedigreed breed, the Australian Bulldog is recognized as a breed by the general public.

It is one of the oldest <a href=\"/terrier-dog-breeds/\">terrier type dogs</a>, originating in the British Isles in the 17th century. It was used by farmers who needed dogs to help get rid of the animals that would prey on the farmers stock, such as fox and rats and other small vermin. The Fox Terrier would find the animal in the ground, relentlessly digging, barking, growling and lunging until it harassed the animal out of its den where the hunter could then kill it. The Fox Terrier came in both a smooth coat and a wirehaired coat and both were considered the same breed for many years. The Wirehaired Fox Terrier was bred by crossing in the rough coated Black and Tan Terrier, for use in rough country, its coat being less vulnerable to damage than that of the Smooth Fox Terrier. The first standard for the Smooth Fox Terrier was established in 1876, separating it from the wirehaired dogs. However, they are still considered the same breed with different coat varieties by some clubs, but have been separated in the United States since 1984. Both the Smooth Fox Terrier and the <a href=\"/all-dog-breeds/wire-fox-terrier.html\">Wirehaired Fox Terrier</a> were recognized by the AKC in 1885.

The Chinese Shar-Pei likely shares a common ancestor with the <a href=\"/all-dog-breeds/chow-chow.html\">Chow Chow</a>, which also originates from China and has a blue-black tongue. Chinese Shar-Peis served as guard dogs, hunters, fighters, workers, and companions for peasants and farmers. Most Chinese dogs were killed after the Communist revolution, but the Shar-Pei was kept alive by breeders in Taiwan and Hong Kong, who brought it to America. Touted as the world&rsquo;s rarest dog in Time Magazine and The Guinness Book of World Records, the breed became popular and was saved from the brink of extinction.
